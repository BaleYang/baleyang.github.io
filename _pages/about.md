I am Jianing Yang, a Master's student in Creative Informatics at the University of Tokyo, advised by <a href='https://researchmap.jp/read0102891/'>Prof. Hiroshi Saruwatari</a>. My research interests lie in speech processing and generative models, including expressive TTS, speech-to-speech, and end-to-end dialog systems. Previously, I worked as an AI/Research Engineer Intern at Huawei Japan, IVRy Inc., SB Intuitions, and NTT Human Informatics Laboratories, focusing on efficient vision models and advanced speech generation.

Before UTokyo, I received my B.Eng. in Information and Communications Engineering at Institute of Science Tokyo (advised by <a href='http://www.ts.ip.titech.ac.jp/shinot/index.html//'>Prof. Takahiro Shinozaki</a>). I enjoy building practical systems that blend state-of-the-art models with reliable engineering.

Feel free to reach me via email, and check my publications and cv pages for more details.
